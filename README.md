# CPUSchedulersSimulator
This project simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms. It is designed to help understand how various scheduling methods manage processes, such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin, etc. The simulation helps visualize process management in operating systems.
